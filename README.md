My OS
==========

This is the beginnings of OS development project I undertook for personal study. But so far I have just created the bootloader in x86 assembly. As it is right now, can be built onto a .iso. Of course we are still missing other compnents that make an OS an OS. Feel free to submit suggestions, improvements or anything else.
