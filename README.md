==========

These are the beginnings of OS development project I undertook out of personal interest. But so far I have just created the bootloader in x86 assembly. As it is right now, the code can be built onto a .iso. Of course we are still missing other major components that make an OS an OS, which I will eventually get to. Feel free to submit suggestions, improvements or anything other type of contribution to this project.
